# Photo-Editor

This is a very simple photo editor I made using python with the Pillow Python Library.

To use this automated photo editor you must create two folders: imgs & editedImgs

Next add all the photos you want to edit into the imgs folder and run photoEditor.py.

```terminal
python photoEditor.py
```

The edits I chose were to sharpen the image, change the photo from color to grayscale, and mess with the constrast a bit.
Although you can create your own edits following the pillow library documentation.
